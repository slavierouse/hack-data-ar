My name is Shaheen, I'm a Data analyst

Hook: The exciting thing about Lyft data is that like our app it happens in the world around us. Why can't we visualize it that way too?

That's why I created Augmented Reality Data visualization. Point your phone camera around you and see Lyft in action.
This can help teams from ops to autonomous make better decisions.

Check out drivers around the office Friday at 5pm. Red drivers are idle, blue on the way to a passenger, and green with a passenger.

The good citizen challenge is about streamlining pickup and dropoff on valencia st. Instead of staring at a map, let's go there and find where venues make the most sense. Dark green are pin locations, bright green are pickup points. Dark red is destination pins, and bright red dropoff points.

There's still much to do from animations to a superset integration. Let's make it so anyone can see their data in the real world and in real time.
